## What it does

### Real-time gameplay

When you click on a clue on the board, it pops up on the screen for every player
at the same time.

You all get a chance to read the clue, then race to buzz in. The fastest buzzer
gets to answer the clue and gets points if they're right. If they're wrong, the
buzzers reopen for all other players.

### Upload your own games

I made a JSON file format so people can upload their own games. The format
allows for an arbitrary number of rounds, categories per round, and clues per
category. I hope this flexibility is fun for constructors!

The [upload help][upload-help] page describes the format and has a sample file.

Games can also be _unlisted_ or _private_ so constructors can play their games or
playtest draft games without sharing them widely.

## How it's built

Jep! is built in [React][react] using the [Remix][remix] web framework. The
backend is not a persistent server but rather a collection of [serverless
functions][serverless] that respond to HTTP requests. All persistent data is
stored in a database. The frontend uses [websockets][websockets] to subscribe to
real-time updates to the database.

### Room logic (state machine)

Choosing a game from the home page creates a new "room". Every player joins the
room from their own web browser. Each player sees the same initial room state
(round not yet started, all clues are hidden, everyone's score is 0, etc.).

Players then take actions in the room that modify the state. For example, a
player chooses a clue, then buzzes in to answer.

The room [state machine][state-machine] is implemented as a [reducer][reducer]
in React.

![Simplified room state machine]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/jep/state-machine.jpg)

Each room state also has a corresponding client-only mini state machine.

### Storing room state

Instead of storing the room state itself in one database row, we store the list
of _actions_ that have occurred in the room.

- **Reads:** Fetch all the actions for the room, then apply each action one by
  one to the initial state to get the current state.
- **Writes:** When a player takes a new action, the client sends an HTTP POST
  request to the server, which appends it to the list of actions in the database.

This is called an [event sourcing][event-sourcing] architecture. Writes are fast
because they append to the list of actions without worrying about the current
state or any other actions. It also makes it easy to replay the actions to
compute the state at any point in time.

Each client has a local state machine which computes the current state from past
actions.

|--|--|--|
| **ID** | **Room ID** | **Action Type** | **Action Data** |
| 1 | 803 | join | `{name: player 1, userId: 123}` |
| 2 | 803 | join | `{name: player 2, userId: 456}` |
| 3 | 803 | start round | `{round: 0}` |
| 3 | 803 | choose clue | `{i: 0, j: 0, userId: 123}` |
| 4 | 803 | buzz in | `{i: 0, j: 0, userId: 456, deltaMs: 351}` |
| 5 | 803 | buzz in | `{i: 0, j: 0, userId: 123, deltaMs: 489}` |
| 6 | 803 | check answer | `{i: 0, j: 0, userId: 456, correct: true}` |

_Example actions table_

```ts
const state: State = {
  type: RoomState.RevealAnswerToAll,
  activeClue: [0, 0],
  boardControl: 456,
  buzzes: { 123: 489, 456: 351 },
  isAnswered: [
    [{ isAnswered: true, answeredBy: 456 } /* ... */],
    // ...
  ],
  players: {
    123: {
      name: "player 1",
      score: 0,
    },
    456: {
      name: "player 2",
      score: 200,
    },
  },
  round: 0,
  // ... more state
};
```

### Timeout actions + serverless functions

Some actions aren't really player-initiated, but have to be modeled as such
because there's no persistent server running on the backend. For example, what
if no players buzz in within 5 seconds to answer a clue? There's no server-side
timer tracking this, so all the players would be stuck waiting for someone to
buzz in.

To fix this, each client submits a "5 seconds elapsed" action after the timeout.
Upon receiving any "5 seconds elapsed" message the state machine advances the
room state to the next step.

### Real-time updates

If Player 1 chooses a clue, how does Player 2 see that clue pop up on their
screen at the same time? In other words, how do they read one anothers' writes
in real time without refreshing the page?

The client subscribes to real-time updates from the "actions" table. This opens
a websocket connection to the [Supabase realtime][supabase-realtime] server. When the actions table
receives a new row, the server broadcasts the row to all clients subscribed to
that action's room ID.

The client then receives that action and applies it to its local state machine.
This way all clients have a consistent view of the room state.

## Designing Jeopardy! without a host

The biggest difference between the show and Jep! is that there's **no host** to
communicate what's happening at any given time, keep up the momentum, and check
answers. The first two can be addressed with good design, but the last one is
trickier.

### Check your own answers

I didn't want to require one player be the host, or make any player check other
players' answers. I also didn't want to try to make a ~virtual host~ for a
couple reasons:

1. There are often multiple correct answers to a question, like "aubergine" vs
   "eggplant" or "Queen Elizabeth" vs "Elizabeth I". I don't have an automated way
   to check this for all questions.
1. I don't want players to have to type, which means the virtual host would have
   to use speech recognition. I find speech recognition annoying and error-prone.

Having each player check their own answers keeps the game fast-paced and doesn't
put the hosting burden on one person in particular.

Groups also develop house rules for which answers are "close enough" to be
correct. Self-checking helps account for more and less strict play styles.
However, it's not as suited to a competitive tournament setting.

### Say your guess, then check privately

We keep players honest by having them say their guess out loud to others before
checking it. This requires players to join a voice call or the same physical
room together.

Here's an example transcript:

```
PLAYER 1: Ferns for $600.

**Text: FERNS FIRST EMERGE IN THE FOSSIL RECORD IN THIS PERIOD**

PLAYER 1: [Buzzes in]
PLAYER 1: Hmm... what is the Jurassic period?
PLAYER 1: [Privately sees the answer]
PLAYER 1: Drat!
PLAYER 1: [Marks "incorrect"]

**Buzzers reopen**

PLAYER 2: [Buzzes in]
PLAYER 2: Ah, it's me! What is the Devonian period?
PLAYER 2: [Privately sees the answer]
PLAYER 2: Yep!
PLAYER 2: [Marks "correct"]

**Text: DEVONIAN**
```

_Example game transcript with honest players_
{: .caption}

With this scheme, you can tell later if someone lied. If they said "Jurassic"
was correct, you'd know they lied when the game later showed the answer was
"Devonian".

This design _is_ clunkier than having a host: it's hart not to blurt out the
answer as soon as you learn you were wrong! It adds more cognitive burden during
an emotional moment in the game.

### Keeping up momentum

I tried to make the visuals as clear as possible, but it's still sometimes
confusing who's up next to choose the clue or who won the buzz-in. This
confusion slows the game momentum and keeps it from moving as snappily as a
20-minute TV show.

I also love using my phone for everything and tried to make the game
mobile-friendly, but not everything can fit on phone screens smaller than mine.
There's also a design tension between showing all possible information and
controlling what's shown to keep the stakes high.

These problems are related! I definitely hit the limits of my UI design skills.
I would love to get specific feedback or designs that would improve this. For
now, I'm happy the game generally works and am ready to move on to other
projects.

## Conclusion

A major inspiration for Jep! was [Down for a Cross][d4ac], a collaborative
crossword website. I wanted to make something similar for Jeopardy! to hopefully
give back to the trivia fan community.

I implemented a minimal set of features from Down for a Cross, plus the
Jeopardy! game logic. Some fun additions could be:

- Timing the game with a clock
- An in-browser puzzle creator instead of just JSON files
- Coryat score tracking
- ...[And more!][enhancements]

Thank you to all the playtesters who gave great feedback! Your insight into my
fundamental design problems kept me awake at night. Thanks in particular to
Alex, Jynnie, Tommy, and Neil, as well as the NCSJ, JJSR, MJKT+, and GACJI
playtest groups.

I hope people enjoy playing Jep! and I'd love to hear any feedback or ideas for
improvements. Play a game [here][jep] and check out the code [here][github]!
